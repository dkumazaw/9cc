**NOTE**: This project is no longer active. Currently I am working on [the Rust version](https://github.com/dkumazaw/yarcc)!

This is a WIP hobby C compiler written in C. The goal of this project is to support a subset of ANSI C so that the compiler can be self-hosted.
This project is inspired by Rui Ueyama's book on building a C compiler: https://www.sigbus.info/compilerbook/
